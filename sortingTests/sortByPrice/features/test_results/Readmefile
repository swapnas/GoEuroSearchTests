The automation test cases in this repository are using Cucumber framework. (www.cucumber.io)

To Run the given test case you will need to have the following installed:

• Install cucumber framework (see instructions on cucumber.io)
• Ruby v1.9+
• Watir (Web Application Testing in Ruby),a programmer-friendly inbrowser
test library

• Watir WebDriver,a Watir implementation that uses WebDriver under
the hood

• (Chrome users) ChromeDriver, a stand-alone program that helps Watir
control Google Chrome


To launch the browser once at the beginning of the test run and shut it down as Cucumber is exiting the following code needs to added to the env.rb file:
require 'watir-webdriver'
require 'nokogiri'
module HasBrowser
@@browser = Watir::Browser.new :chrome
at_exit { @@browser.close }
def browser
